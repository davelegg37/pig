		<div>Back</div>
		<div>NEXT</div>
		<div></div>
		<div>Listen</div>
		<div>The pig was a pig. He looked like a pig, he ate like a pig, he had the manners of a pig. He never worried about his piggyness. He wallowed, ate and slept. He was totally content and secure.</div>
		<div>One night as the pig lay sleeping a gadfly landed in his ear. </div>
		<div>Now the gadfly being a gadfly could not resist being mischievous and he whispered into the pig's ear, "You are not a pig." The pig slowly opening his eyes, was again greeted with, "You are not a pig." An ear twitched and the fly was gone but the thought remained, "You are not a pig."</div>
		<div>Poor pig turned all night long. "I am a pig.  I look like a pig, I act like a pig, I eat like a pig, I must be a pig." But the doubt persisted. “I might be lying to myself. I might not be a pig. How can I prove I'm a pig?"</div>
		<div>The pig continued to struggle with his deepening identity crisis until an idea dawned in his little pig brain. "I'm not a chicken," thought the pig, "so I must be a pig."  This rather tenuous logic seemed conclusive to the pig. The thought, "Pigs aren't chickens and chickens aren't pigs. Therefore I must be a pig," brought immediate relief to his doubt stricken mind.</div>
		<div>"Chickens lay eggs. They walk funny.  Chickens cluck and make strange noises. They are weak and little.”  The more he thought of all the differences between pigs and chickens the more piggy he felt.</div>
		<div>He discovered that the more he exaggerated the differences the better he felt. He found particular solace in such thoughts as: "A chicken is only good for laying eggs. Chickens should stay in the coup where they belong. You can't depend on chickens in a crisis, all they do is squawk."  The pig reached new heights of piggyness by reveling in these thoughts.</div>
		<div>The next day the pig made another discovery. He found actually picking on chickens made him feel like a great big pig. He started confronting chickens with such statements as, "A chicken's place is in the coup” and "Chickens were put on earth for the pleasure of pigs."  He got particular pleasure from waddling up to some lone chicken and shouting, "Go back to the coop where you belong."</div>
		<div>The barnyard was completely disrupted by the pigs guest for psychic security through chicken abuse. The pig would roll on any chicken that displayed open defiance (fortunately for the pig he had chosen chickens and not horses as the targets for his bigotry). Before long most chickens stayed in the coop for fear of their lives. Worse yet some chickens began to believe what the pig was saying about them and their behavior began to reflect this belief. The other animals of the barnyard were embarrassed by the pig's bullying of the chickens and started to avoid the barnyard. The whole barnyard began to deteriorate.</div>
		<div>The farmer observing this deterioration, decided that something had to be done. But what? He rejected making a rule prohibiting barnyard bullying; the pig had a history of violating barnyard rules.</div>
		<div>"I'll talk to the pig," he thought. "Surely he'll respond to reason." But after many long and frustrating conversations it began clear that pigs were very unreasonable animals. "What to do? What to do?" A solution had to be found. "Smoked Ham!" That was the answer, "smoked ham".</div>
		<div>The barnyard has returned to normal. The pig was no longer a problem and each morning his remains prove their porkiness at the farmer's breakfast table.
